# A Couple of fun visualization things written in JavaScript

Currently there are
 - Frequency bars dancing
 - Circular frequency bars dancing
 - ThreeJs cube dancing on

I would like to do next

 - An integration with MatterJs and do an audio visualization
 - An integration with PaperJs and ThreeJs and raster and image and display it in 3D
 - Work more with css vars and toy around with getting the whole application to dance
 - Add more tests
 - Make the app look a lot nicer...
